## What is Psoriasis?

Psoriasis is a chronic, proliferative and inflammatory disease which mostly affects the skin. Once it appears, most people 
discover reddish and scaly spots firstly on their elbows and knees. As the disease develops, the spots grow and spread all over the body. 
The involved areas are itchy and tend to bleed after scratching. Also, psoriasis can affect the joints and eyes, but the most
common type is the plaque type which appears on the skin. There is no cure for psoriasis, and what's more, it goes down and up in episodes.
It is important to mention that the disease is not contagious. It is considered as an autoimmune disease. For better understanding the disease
and to clearly describe what happens to the body, i will now quote the [National Library of Medicine:](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK448194/#article-27961.s2)

>The pathophysiology of psoriasis involves infiltration of the skin by activated T cells which stimulate the proliferation of keratinocytes. This dysregulation in keratinocyte turnover results in the formation of thick plaques. Other associated features include epidermal hyperplasia and parakeratosis. In addition, the epidermal cells fail to secrete lipids which results in flaky and scaly skin, which is typical of psoriasis.

## Living with Psoriasis - is it easy?

There is more than just the itchy skin with plaque on it, and it is not easy to live with it at all.
Psoriasis is a very obvious disease, it is difficult to hide it unless one wants to fully cover their body when going out.
People tend to stare and point the finger on someone who looks different. Furthermore, suffering from psoriasis does affect the
everyday life by being painful when it comes to movements which include the affected areas of the body, e.g. walking if the knees are
affected by plaque. In addition, there is the need to scratch the afflicted areas due to the itching, which, among other things, 
makes people with psoriasis spread their dandruff at every place they sit or lay down. This might not be bad in general, since everyone has 
a vacuum or something else, but for the person themselves it can be a range from emberassing to really depressing.
Depressing is the key word for the next topic which comes up when talking about psoriasis - depression.
Psoriasis affects the entire life of a person. Rejection from other people who don't know the disease, the decreased life quality
and the whole process of seeing doctors, not to know if it ends someday can lead to 
depressions and other mental diseases.

## What one can do

Since psoriasis is a disease which can not be cured, it will last the entire life. All a patient for him- or herself can do is to keep their skin moisturized 
with appropriate skin cream and to enjoy the hours of the day the sun comes out. Also, a healthy lifestyle can be a great advantage. Exercising on a regular basis as well as consulting a mental health counsellor are most helpful when it comes to healing the skin and the body. 

In severe cases, there is also the possibility to do phototherapy or even to take certain systemic drugs which supress the immune system of the patient. This kind of therapy is considered to take place only when the other known methods do not bring the desired outcome - to ease the suffering of the patient. 

In order to enhance the life quality on their own, patients must be aware of possible factors which trigger flare-ups and which kind of things are known to ease the symptoms. The most common thing which is known to ease the symptoms is the sun, while the most common flare-up-triggers are:
+ Stress
+ Alcohol
+ Smoking
+ Dry, cold weather.

But also, there is to mention that everyone has their own triggers which are to be found through own experiences.
